Pipeline implementation:-----

  1. file will come in S3

  2. lambda will be called  (triggering)
    (interview question how you used lambda)

  3. lambda will trigger "step function" start

  4. again a lambda will be called (second lambda)

  5. second lambda will dump the "S3 data" in "RDS"

**6. An email will be triggered that "S3 data dumped into RDS"

  7. Again a lambda will be called (third lambda)

  8. third lambda will dump "RDS data" into "S3"
    (pick 3 columns out of 10 columns from RDS and dump in to S3)

**9. Again an email will be triggered "RDS data dumped into S3"

  10. Again a lambda will be called (fourth lambda)

  11. fourth lambda will dump "S3 data" into "Redshift"

**12. Again an email will be triggered "Data dumped into Redshift"

  13. End  ( All services will be integrated)



File will come in "S3"

"Lambda" will be called

"Lambda" will trigger "Step function"

"Lambda" (2nd)

Dump "S3 data" in "RDS"

Email "S3 data dumped into RDS"

"Lambda" (3rd)

Dump "RDS data" into "S3"
(pick 3 columns out of 10 columns from RDS and dump in to S3)

Email "RDS data dumped into S3"

"Lambda" (4th)

Dump "S3 data" into "Redshift"

Email "Data dumped into Redshift"

End
